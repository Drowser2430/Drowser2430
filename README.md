# 🧠 Government Spending Prediction using Machine Learning

### 📊 Overview
This project uses a simple Linear Regression model to predict future U.S. healthcare spending based on past trends (2017–2023). Built in Python using public data, it demonstrates how machine learning can support public-sector budgeting and decision-making.

### 🛠️ How It Works
1. **Load & Visualize Data**  
   Simulated U.S. federal spending data from 2017–2023 is used to visualize historical trends.

2. **Train the Model**  
   A Linear Regression model is trained to learn the relationship between year and spending.

3. **Make Predictions**  
   Forecasts are generated for 2024 and 2025 spending.

4. **Evaluate Performance**  
   Model performance is measured using Mean Absolute Error and R² Score.

5. **Plot Predictions**  
   Visuals compare actual vs predicted values with trend lines.

### 📈 Sample Output

Predicted healthcare spending in 2024: $1132.14B
Predicted healthcare spending in 2025: $1200.18B

### 🧠 Takeaways
- Predictive modeling helps governments make more data-informed budgeting decisions.
- Even simple regression models can offer value in long-term financial planning.
- This prototype can be expanded with real-world datasets (e.g., from USAspending.gov) for broader use.
